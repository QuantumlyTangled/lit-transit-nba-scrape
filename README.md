# lit-transport-nba-scrape

This is my attempt at the take-home project provided by Lit-Transport.
The instructions can be found [here](./LIT%20programming%20task_Java.pdf) though I was instructed to use [Basketball reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_per_game.html) instead of [NBA stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/).

```shell
$ nba Luka Doncic
2018-19 7.1
2019-20 8.9
2020-21 8.3
```

## Notes
  * The displayed data is scraped from the "Per Game" table on the players profile.
  * The CLI tries to cover as many edge cases as possible but alas each time I solve one I find another.
